# REST API Example

This repository contains a simple starter example for implementing a REST API using [Jakarta EE](https://jakarta.ee/specifications/restful-ws/).
The example features authentication using JWT, via the [java-jwt](https://github.com/auth0/java-jwt) library by Auth0.
The example also includes a built-in [Grizzly](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.grizzly) server to serve the REST API,
and a Dockerfile to run the REST API in a Docker container.
Last but not least, a few examples of client code using the developed API are available (see the end of the README).


## REST API Endpoints
The example includes three endpoints.

### /auth endpoint
POST requests with a JSON containing a username and a password can be sent to this endpoint.
If the provided user credentials are valid, a JWT is issued and returned in the response.

### /greet endpoint
This endpoint supports GET requests. If the requests contain no Authorization 
header, a default message is returned as a response.
If the requests contains a valid JWT, a custom message showing the username 
associated with the JWT is returned.

### /todo endpoint
This endpoint can be used to manage a To-do list. It supports the following methods:
* `GET /todos`: returns a list of the stored To-do items;
* `POST /todos`: Expects a JSON with the id, title and description properties in the request body, and saves the new To-do item 
in the list. 
* `DELETE /todos/{id}`: Deletes the To-do Item with the given `{id}`.

## Running the REST API locally (requires Java 17+)
To run the REST API locally, build the project using Maven and run the `Main` class 
from your IDE.
By default, the REST API will be available at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/).

## Running the REST API with Docker
To build a docker image, run 
```
docker build -t "todo-rest-api-image" .
```
To run the image, run
```
docker run -p 9000:8080 -it --name todo-rest-api-container todo-rest-api-image
```
The REST API will be available at [http://localhost:9000/](http://localhost:9000/).

## Client
This repository includes also examples on how to write client code that uses the REST API. 
Some tests (see `src/test/java/it/unina/webtech/` show how to write client code using the Jakarta EE Client classes. 
The example in `/src/main/java/client/Client.java`, on the other hand, uses the 
HttpClient included in the Java Standard library since Java 11.
